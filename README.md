Welcome to the ECSE 321 - Group 14 -Fall 2020 project!

## Scope of the project: 

The scope of the project is to develop a gallery system for the Art Gallery to work online in the current pandemic situation.
The main goal of this project is to connect local artists with potential buyers through a web and mobile application. Artist are able to create a profile and expose their artworks. Artist can also choose to display their work which are not for sale and add their biography. Potential buyers can browse through an inventory which contains available artworks. They can also filter the inventory by artist, artwork type and year. If they are interested by an artwork, a buyer can place an order for one or more artworks. Once their order has been processed, the buyer can choose to get his order delivered to his house, or pick it up directly at the gallery. In addition to artist directly selling their work, the Gallery can also showcase the artworks on their premises. Although these artworks cannot be bought online, they are available directly in the store.
